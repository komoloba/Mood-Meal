   - **Grab from Market** - Ready/semi-ready meal combinations
   - **Order Nearby** - Restaurant suggestions (region-template)
3. After eating (30-90 minutes), conducts a follow-up 5-question test

5. Tracks your history with mood uplift metrics

### Core Mood Dimensions
```kotlin
enum class MoodDim {
    valence,     // Positive/negative feelings
    arousal,     // Energy level
    stress,      // Tension/pressure
    craving,     // Food desire intensity
    bodysense    // Physical comfort
}
```

### Nutrition Tracking
All meals include detailed nutritional information:
- Calorie ranges (low/est/high)
- Macros: Protein (p), Fat (f), Carbs (c)
- Allergen warnings

### Suggestion Algorithm
Simple rule-based matching:
- **High Stress (‚â•0.6)**: Warm, soothing meals (soups, complex carbs)
- **High Arousal (‚â•0.6)**: Fresh, light meals (salads, cold dishes)
- **Default**: Balanced options
